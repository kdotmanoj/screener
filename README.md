# Stock Screener Application

## Overview
The Stock Screener is a web-based tool designed to help users filter stocks based on various financial parameters. The application provides a simple interface where users can input screening criteria, and the stock table dynamically updates based on the given conditions.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Query Input**: Users can type in their filter criteria, and the table is automatically updated to display only the stocks that meet all specified conditions.
- **Filtering**: Supports conditions such as Greater than, Less than, or Equal to for each of the nine financial parameters (e.g., Market Capitalization, P/E Ratio, etc.).
- **AND Logic**: All conditions must be met for a stock to appear in the results.
- **Sorting**: Allows users to sort the stock table by any column (e.g., Market Cap, P/E Ratio, etc.).
- **Pagination**: Results are paginated if more than 10 stocks match the filter criteria.

## Screening Logic
The stock screening logic is based on the conditions defined by the user. The system uses AND-only logic, meaning that a stock must meet all of the specified conditions in order to appear in the result table.

### Example Filters:
- Market Cap: Greater than â‚¹300 Cr
- P/E Ratio: Less than 30
- ROE: Greater than 15%

These filters are applied in real-time as the user types in their criteria.

## User Interface
The user interface has two key sections:

### Query Section:
- Users can input filter conditions for stock parameters like Market Capitalization, P/E Ratio, ROE, etc.
- As the user types or selects options, the stock table is automatically updated to reflect the filtered results.

### Results Table:
- Displays a list of stocks that match the filtering criteria.
- Columns include parameters like Stock Name, Market Cap, P/E Ratio, ROE, etc.
- Results can be sorted by clicking on the column headers.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS 
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Sorting & Pagination**: JavaScript functions for sorting and paginating results
